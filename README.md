# anagram-service

Play Framework based anagram-service to implement an anagram-service

The task

You need to put together a simple web application that can produce anagrams of words from a wordlit.

路  You can find a copy of our wordlist at http://static.abscond.org/wordlist.txt
路  Non-alphanumeric characters should be considered as part of the anagram (e.g. "he's" is not an anagram of "she")
路  The application should be able to respond to a request made every second
路  Assume that the application will be hosted on heroku
Details

The application should be able to receive an HTTP GET request with the requested word as the path. It should return the results as JSON. See the example below:

GET /crepitus
{"crepitus":["cuprites","pictures","piecrust"]}


GET /crepitus,paste,kinship,enlist,boaster,fresher,sinks,knits,sort
{"crepitus":["cuprites","pictures","piecrust"],"paste":["pates","peats","septa","spate","tapes","tepas"],"kinship":["pinkish"],"enlist":["elints","inlets","listen","silent","tinsel"],"boaster":["boaters","borates","rebatos","sorbate"],"fresher":["refresh"],"sinks":["skins"],"knits":["skint","stink","tinks"],"sort":["orts","rots","stor","tors"]}


GET /sdfwehrtgegfg
